Before unearthing this letter, I had questioned myself about the ways
in which a book can be infinite. I could think of nothing other than a
cyclic volume, a circular one. A book whose last page was identical
with the first, a book which had the possibility of continuing
indefinitely. I remembered too that night which is at the middle of
the Thousand and One Nights when Scheherazade (through a magical
oversight of the copyist) begins to relate word for word the story of
the Thousand and One Nights, establishing the risk of coming once
again to the night when she must repeat it, and thus on to infinity.
